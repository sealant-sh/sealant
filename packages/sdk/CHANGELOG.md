# @sealant/sdk

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a551b17: Rename the product's core noun from `sandbox` to `workspace` across the public API and SDK.
  "Workspace" is the honest, industry-standard name for the live, disposable environment a harness
  works in — Sealant does not provide a hardened security sandbox, so the old name over-promised
  containment. The `run` and `harness` nouns are unchanged.

  Concretely, this changes web and API routes from `/sandboxes` to `/workspaces`, renames the SDK
  surface (`sealant.sandboxes` → `sealant.workspaces`, and the `sandbox` handle to `workspace`),
  switches the SSH username prefix from `sbx-` to `ws-`, adds a rename-only database migration for the
  workspace tables and columns, and renames the internal `@sealant/sandboxes` package to
  `@sealant/workspaces`.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 2b90be5: Platform release: interactive-run telemetry ingest re-enabled (run-keyed) with honest
  head-loss accounting. No SDK surface changes — this release keeps the package versions in lockstep
  with the self-host images that actually record interactive sessions.

### Patch Changes

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6234d20: First public release of the fluent SDK.
  - `harness.run(prompt)` — blocking one-shot execution: registers the run server-side, resolves
    once terminal with the captured changes (files + diff) inline.
  - `harness.start(prompt)` — non-blocking: same server-side run, returns the live `Run` handle
    immediately; stream progress with `run.record.stream()` and settle with `run.wait()`.
  - `run.wait()` now fetches the server-side captured changes once the run is terminal, so handles
    from `start()` and `runs.get()` settle with an honest diff.
  - Execution-record read surface: `replay()`, `timeline()`, `stream()`, `scrollback()`,
    `commands()`, `transcript()`, `loss()`, `summary()`.
  - `@sealant/api-contracts` ships as the contract-first HTTP API definition the SDK's client is
    derived from.
