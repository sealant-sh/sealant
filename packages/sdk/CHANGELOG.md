# @sealant/sdk

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 63824ae: Workspace creation accepts additional caller-owned mounts beside the primary source:
  `workspaces.create({ mounts: [{ hostPath, mountPath, readOnly }] })`. Extra mounts are read-only by
  default and bind at a container path outside the working directory (e.g. `/workspace/ref/effect`) —
  they widen what the workspace can see, not where its work product lands. Host paths ride the same
  operator allowlist as mount sources (`SEALANT_MOUNT_ALLOWED_STORE_ROOTS`); the control plane rejects
  container paths overlapping the working directory or the daemon control dir. Like the primary mount,
  extra mount paths are caller-owned — never reprovisioned, never cleaned.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- d160516: Fix `session.attach`: the WS route now addresses the daemon's session id (and rejects
  non-running sessions with a 409) instead of passing the control plane's id to the daemon.
  - @sealant/api-contracts@0.8.1

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 091ef5c: A real data plane for interactive terminals: `session.attach()` over one held WebSocket.

  The request/response session verbs made every keystroke pay auth + DB lookups + a fresh
  short-lived daemon connection (a `docker exec` spawn per event on the default transport), and
  output rode a 250ms journal poll — hopeless for an interactive terminal. New raw route
  `GET /v1/sessions/:sessionId/attach` upgrades to a WebSocket, authenticates once, opens ONE daemon
  control connection for the socket's lifetime, and bridges the daemon's reliable attach channel
  (byte-exact replay from `?from=`, then live output) both ways. Binary frames are PTY bytes; text
  frames are control JSON (`{"t":"resize",...}` up, `{"t":"end"}` down). The SDK exposes it as
  `session.attach({from})` → `SessionAttachment` (`send`/`resize`/`output`/`closed`/`close`). The
  existing `send`/`output` verbs remain the request/response control plane.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- e0aab44: Strip the create-payload `credentials` key from the workspace spec before it reaches the
  build job. The SDK folds `credentials` into the spec it sends; the api lowers it into
  `runtime.credentialRefs` but previously left the raw key in place, and the worker's strict
  blueprint schema rejected it — killing every `mount` + `credentials` create at
  `parseWorkspaceBlueprint` ("Unrecognized key: credentials"). Mount-sourced workspaces with
  connected-account credentials now build.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 649d965: Mount-sourced workspaces, first-class interactive PTY sessions, scoped access tokens, and
  byte-exact resumable session output — the Mend agent-workbench P0 surfaces (plan §8.1.A/§8.1.B).
  - **Mount source**: `workspaces.create({ source: { kind: "mount", path } })` provisions the
    workspace from a caller-owned host directory bind-mounted as the working directory instead of a
    clone (sealantd ≥ 0.6.0). The path is caller-owned: writes persist across stop/restart/expiry
    and the platform never reprovisions or deletes it. Paths must be proper descendants of an
    operator-configured allowlist root (`SEALANT_MOUNT_ALLOWED_STORE_ROOTS`, enforced at the API,
    the launch adapter, and daemon boot). Credentials and dotfiles options compose unchanged;
    clone-based workspaces are unaffected.
  - **Interactive sessions**: `workspace.sessions.open(argv)` / `.get(id)` / `.list()` and a real
    `harness.session()`. Sessions are durable platform resources: the PTY survives handle and
    process loss, and a session re-fetched by id from any workspace handle supports `send()` (string
    or bytes), `resize()`, `signal()`, `status()` (with the output high-water cursor), and
    `close()`. New control-plane endpoints under `/v1/sessions`, including an SSE live tail
    (`/v1/sessions/:id/output/stream`).
  - **Byte-exact resumable output**: session output is recorded redacted and sequence-keyed;
    `session.output({ from })` replays exact history and continues into the live tail, resumable
    after any disconnect via `lastChunk.sequence + 1n`. `GET /v1/runs/:id/scrollback` gains
    `fromSequence`/`limit` range reads and a `pty` stream for interactive runs.
  - **Scoped access tokens**: `sealant.accessTokens.create({ scopes, workspaceId?, ttl? })` mints
    bearer tokens over three scopes — `session:read` (stream/status), `session:input`
    (input/resize/signal), `workspace:exec` (open terminals) — enforced on the session surface, so a
    read-stream token can stream but is rejected for input and exec.
  - **Server-side run commands**: run invocations for built-in harnesses are constructed by the
    control plane (persisted on the run), so `workspaces.get(id)` handles can start harness runs; an
    explicit client command remains the `customHarness()` escape hatch.
  - **Correlation metadata**: opaque `metadata` bags accepted at run and session creation, stored
    verbatim and echoed on reads.
  - sealantd image pin bumped to 0.6.0 (mount boot contract, durable PTY session journal, file
    events on by default).

### Patch Changes

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 6d1d72d: Workspace lifecycle close-out: `workspace.stop()`, `workspace.restart()`, and
  `workspace.expire()` are real end-to-end operations instead of `SealantNotImplementedError`
  rejections.

  - New control-plane endpoints: `POST /v1/workspaces/:id/stop` (async 202 — the worker removes the
    container and records the terminal `stopped` state), `POST /v1/workspaces/:id/restart` (async
    202 — a fresh launch from the same resolved spec, recorded as a new attempt), and
    `POST /v1/workspaces/:id/expire` (sets, clears, or triggers the workspace TTL).
  - `WorkspaceStatus` gains `"stopped"`, and workspace summaries/details expose `expiresAt`.
  - `createWorkspace` accepts an optional `ttlSeconds`; the SDK's `create()` accepts
    `ttl: "2h"`-style durations. Expired workspaces are stopped by the platform reaper.
  - SDK `stop()` blocks until the workspace reports `stopped`; `restart()` returns a fresh handle
    whose `ready()` gates on the new runtime; `expire({ in: "2h" | null })` sets or clears the TTL.

  Compatibility: adding `"stopped"` to the workspace status enum changes the wire contract — older
  published SDKs decode workspace responses against the previous five-value literal union and will
  fail to decode a stopped workspace. Upgrade the SDK together with the control plane.

### Patch Changes

- f4c35ca: `workspaces.create()` without a `ref` now really does use the repository's default
  branch, as the option's docs always claimed. The SDK no longer lowers a missing `ref` to `"main"`,
  the blueprint schema keeps the workspace source `ref` truly optional instead of defaulting it, and
  the docker runtime adapter omits `SEALANT_WORKSPACE_REPO_REF` entirely when unset so sealantd's
  plain `git clone` resolves the remote HEAD. Previously every repository whose default branch isn't
  `main` (e.g. `master`) failed workspace boot with
  `fatal: Remote branch main not found in upstream origin`. Requires sealantd ≥ 0.5.1 in the
  workspace image for the no-ref path.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d2ce1c: Inference on connected accounts. New `inference` contract group:
  `POST /v1/inference/respond` runs short, tool-calling inference loops on the caller's own
  subscription — the server resolves the connected-account reference (same shape as workspace
  creation), decrypts, and invokes the OFFICIAL Claude Agent SDK with `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
  (never raw model-API calls on stored credentials, per the connected-accounts design's hard
  constraint). Caller-defined JSON-schema tools are exposed to the model verbatim; tool calls park
  server-side and the CALLER executes them, posting results back in a multi-turn session loop.
  Structured output rides the agent SDK's native json_schema output format. SDK:
  `sealant.inference.respond(...)` (new exchange or continuation) + `inferenceRespondOp` in the
  Effect core. Usage is attributed per account (`last_used_at`), and a live auth rejection marks the
  account invalid. Claude accounts only; Codex inference is a stated follow-up.
- 012f858: Export the Effect-native core at the `@sealant/sdk/effect` subpath. Effect-end-to-end
  consumers get the contract-derived control-plane client as a service (`SealantApiClient` +
  `sealantApiClientLayer`), one operation effect per contract endpoint, the managed runtime
  (`makeSdkRuntime`), and the typed contract errors on the failure channel — instead of wrapping the
  Promise facade. The README's "will be reachable" promise is now true.
- 5cabebb: Typed record-event taxonomy. `@sealant/api-contracts` now exposes the payload schemas
  behind every recorded event kind (process, io, file, network, runtime, and loss events — the
  stored jsonb shape: uint64s as decimal strings, protocol enums as numbers) plus
  `decodeRecordEventPayload`, a total decoder that folds a wire `(kind, ref)` pair into a
  discriminated union and degrades to an `unknown` case instead of throwing. The SDK's
  `TimelineEntry` is now that discriminated union: switch on `kind` and `data` narrows to the typed
  payload, with `{ kind: "unknown", rawKind, data }` as the forward-compatibility case for kinds
  newer than the SDK. No new event kinds were added; a file-read/open event is noted as future work.
- 436546e: Deterministic exec in a workspace. New contract endpoint `POST /v1/workspaces/:id/exec`
  executes an ORDERED LIST of commands in the workspace, recorded as ONE run (a "check run") on the
  same run-exec pipeline as harness runs — every command executes in order regardless of exit codes
  (a nonzero exit is a check datum, e.g. `base fails · head passes · revert fails`), and the run
  completes iff every command executed and was recorded. SDK: `workspace.exec(argv, { cwd? })`
  returns `{ exitCode, stdout, stderr, run }`, resolving on nonzero exits and rejecting only when
  the execution machinery itself broke.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a551b17: Rename the product's core noun from `sandbox` to `workspace` across the public API and
  SDK. "Workspace" is the honest, industry-standard name for the live, disposable environment a
  harness works in — Sealant does not provide a hardened security sandbox, so the old name
  over-promised containment. The `run` and `harness` nouns are unchanged.

  Concretely, this changes web and API routes from `/sandboxes` to `/workspaces`, renames the SDK
  surface (`sealant.sandboxes` → `sealant.workspaces`, and the `sandbox` handle to `workspace`),
  switches the SSH username prefix from `sbx-` to `ws-`, adds a rename-only database migration for
  the workspace tables and columns, and renames the internal `@sealant/sandboxes` package to
  `@sealant/workspaces`.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 2b90be5: Platform release: interactive-run telemetry ingest re-enabled (run-keyed) with honest
  head-loss accounting. No SDK surface changes — this release keeps the package versions in lockstep
  with the self-host images that actually record interactive sessions.

## 0.3.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bf3dc5e]
  - @sealant/api-contracts@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6234d20: First public release of the fluent SDK.
  - `harness.run(prompt)` — blocking one-shot execution: registers the run server-side, resolves
    once terminal with the captured changes (files + diff) inline.
  - `harness.start(prompt)` — non-blocking: same server-side run, returns the live `Run` handle
    immediately; stream progress with `run.record.stream()` and settle with `run.wait()`.
  - `run.wait()` now fetches the server-side captured changes once the run is terminal, so handles
    from `start()` and `runs.get()` settle with an honest diff.
  - Execution-record read surface: `replay()`, `timeline()`, `stream()`, `scrollback()`,
    `commands()`, `transcript()`, `loss()`, `summary()`.
  - `@sealant/api-contracts` ships as the contract-first HTTP API definition the SDK's client is
    derived from.
